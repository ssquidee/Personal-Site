    <h1>Welcome to my (Empty?) Website</h1>
    <p>Please, make yourself at home. Very little is housed
        here right now, and I haven't the slightest clue what I 
        plan to add. But maybe something fun!
    </p>
    <p>For the purposes of this website, refer to me as ssquidee, though if you
        are here you probably know my real life identity. Pretend you don't! Do we 
        not all desire to be percieved even in private? No? Maybe that's just the exhibitionist
        in me.
    </p>
    <p>If for some reason you have found this and you actually have no idea who I am,
        consider reaching out to tell me how the hell you found me. 
    </p>
    <p>I am just a guy in chicago. If you want to know more about me, consider going <a href="">here</a></p>
    <p>Eventually, these will be links that you can click, but right now it's just a list of ideas</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Pictures of my Cat</a></li>
        <li><a href="">What I ate today</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Sad Thoughts</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Curious about my new years resolutions?</a></li>
        <li><a href="">A blog? a public diary? Who am I if I'm not being percieved by the world?
            will I ever be more than a lowly ssquidee?
        </a></li>
